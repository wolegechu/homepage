## Paper Daily
- Where Classification Fails, Interpretation Rises
    - apply an attention mechanism to the adversarial examples detection
    - uisng attention to defend against adversarial examples
    - (this paper is hard to read)
- Deep Image Prior
    - randomly-initialized neural network can be used as a handcrafted prior with excellent results
    - search in parameter space
    - apply untrianed CNN, fit a G network to a single degraded image.
- Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Autonoumous Driving
    - Deep Deterministic Actor Critic (DDAC)
        - actor: provides the policy mapping from a state to action
        - critic: evaluates the value of the action taken (same as Q-function)

## Review of clustering algorithms
- Clustering
    - k-means
    - k-medoids
    - Gaussian Mixture Model
    - Spectral Clustering
    - Hierachical Clustering
- Other relevant algorithms
    - Expecatation Maximization
    - Dimendsionality Reduction
        - Laplacian Eigenmap
        - Locally Linear Embedding


# Computer orgnisation
- Direct mapping
    - process is divided into pages
    - main memory is divided into frames/blocks
    - cache is divided into lines
