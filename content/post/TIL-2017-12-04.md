## Paper Daily
- (NIPS 2017) Visual Reference Resolution using Attention Memory for Visual Dialog, Paul Hongsuch Seo
    - An associative attention memory storing s sequence of previous (attention, key) pairs
    - Retrieves the previous attention, taking into account recency, which is most relevant for the current Q
    - Resoning ability, maybe the best single model (trained by mle) presently.

## Computer Network Notes
- Classes (think in binary system)
    - CA: 1-126 ($2^{24}-2$)
    - CB: 128-191 ($2^{16}-2$)
    - CC: 192-223 ($2^8-2$)
- DBA: Directed Broadcast Address (NID, HID 1s [11.255.255.255])
- NID: (NID, HID 0s [11.0.0.0])

### Types of casting
- Unicast
- Broadcast
    - Limited
        - 11.0.0.0  |m|11.1.2.3 (Source Address)|255.255.255.255 (Destination Address)|
    - Directed
        - 11.0.0.0  |m|11.1.2.3|20.255.255.255|

### Subnets, Subnet Mask, CIDR
- subnetting disadvantage
    - reach the process complexly
- The difference between in subnet and outside subnet;
- Every subnet waste two IP addresses for the NID and DBA 
    - 2 subnet: For CC: (128 - 2) x 2 = 252
    - 2 subnet: (200.1.2.0) 
- Subnet Mask: 32 bit
    - #1: #NID + #SID, #0: #HID
    - can find out NID
- Variable lenght subnet masking (VLSM)
- Classless Inter Domain Routing
    - (a.b.c.d/n) n: #NID
    - Rules of blocks
        - All IP addrees should be contiguous
        - $2^n$
        - Fast IP address in the block should be evenly divided by size of the block
- Subnetting in CIDR

## Operating System Notes

## File System

### cache memory
- Cache - Paging (main memory) - Secondary Memory
    - Hit latency: the time to hit in the cache
    - Cache hit: a state in which data requested for processing by a component or application is found in the cache memory
    - Cache miss: not found
    - Miss latency: the time (in cycles) the CPU waits when a miss happen in the cache
    - Page fault, Page hit
    - Spatial/temporal locality
- Direct Mapping
    - [Tag | Index | Offset]
    - $2^m$ addresses
    - $2^k$ cache entries
    - $2^n$ block size
    - Step:
        - Use the index part of the address to find the appropriate cache entry
        - CHeck the tag to see if the entry contains the right data
        - If it does, then use the offset to the find the correct byte
