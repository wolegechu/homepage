# About Me

I'm a sophomore major in Electronic Information Science and Technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University. And now conduct research on cross-media with Dr. [Zhou Yu](http://camalab.hdu.edu.cn/people/zhou_yu/index.html) supervised by Prof. [Jun Yu](http://camalab.hdu.edu.cn/people/jun_yu/index.html) in the [Computer Animation and Multimedia Analysis LAB](http://camalab.hdu.edu.cn/).

I’m interested in multimodal artificial intelligence (vision and language) and the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I am studying how to develop multimodal associations in a wider Robotics context. I believe that Reinforcement Learning is an excellent approach to encourage the development of these fields, and it can help us to get close to general AI. I have the determination to solve the difficulties encountered and make my own ideas come true, even starting from the very beginning.
