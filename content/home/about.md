# About Me

I'm a sophomore major in Electronic Information Science and Technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University. I am a member of [Computer Animation and Multimedia Analysis LAB(CAMA-LAB)](camalab.hdu.edu.cn), led by Prof. [Jun Yu](http://camalab.hdu.edu.cn/people/jun_yu/index.html).

I'm interested in multimodal artificial intelligence(vision and language) and the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I want to study how to develop multimodal associations in a wider Robotics context. I believe that Reinforcement Learning is a superduper approach to encourage the development in these fields and it can help us to get close to general AI. I have the determination to solve the difficulties encountered and make my own ideas come true, even start from the very beginning.
