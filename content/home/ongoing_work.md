I'm also doing some enjoyable researches about [VQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00468v6.pdf) and [Visual Dialog](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08669).

The most interesting courses I have been studying are [CS294: Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) and [CS224u: Natural Language Understand](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/). Apart from this, I'm learning generative models like GAN and VAE by reading papers and doing some exercises.
